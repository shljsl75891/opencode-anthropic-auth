## 2.3.0

### Patch Changes

- **Bridge-anchor distance correctness**: `selectHybridMessageAnchors` previously
  measured the 20-block lookback distance by summing only cacheable blocks from
  user-role messages, silently ignoring assistant turns (text, tool_use) and thinking
  blocks. Anthropic's lookback window counts every positional content block regardless
  of role or type. The new `rawBlockCount` helper counts all blocks, and the bridge
  selection loop now walks the full message array — so the bridge fires correctly in
  tool-heavy and thinking-heavy sessions instead of too late or not at all. The
  algorithm now also directly measures the block count between the bridge candidate
  and `latest` (excluding the anchor's own blocks), matching the invariant described
  in the JSDoc. The `MessageAnchorPosition` wrapper type was removed; anchor indices
  are now plain `number | undefined`.
- **Bridge placement tests**: tightened existing bridge test to pin the exact bridge
  index (7); added boundary tests at 20 blocks (bridge placed) and 21 blocks (bridge
  absent); added test confirming no bridge is placed when no valid user anchor exists
  before the overflow point; added `latestIndex === 2` regression test (single rolling
  candidate, no room for bridge).
- **`tool_result` anchor regression test**: verified that a user message containing
  only `tool_result` blocks is correctly selected as a rolling anchor.
- **`context_management` passthrough regression test**: verified that
  `rewriteRequestBody` preserves a client-supplied `context_management` body field
  (e.g. `context-management-2025-06-27` server-side tool-result clearing) untouched.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **SSE retryable-error detection** (ported from cortexkit/anthropic-auth v1.10.0): transient
  Anthropic server errors (`api_error`, `overloaded_error`, `server_error`, `internal_server_error`)
  emitted as SSE events inside HTTP 200 streams are now detected and thrown as
  `ECONNRESET`-coded errors so OpenCode can use its normal auto-retry flow instead of
  surfacing them as non-retryable unknown failures.

### Patch Changes

- **System tail coalescing** (ported from cortexkit/anthropic-auth v1.10.1): when OpenCode or a
  plugin emits system instructions split across multiple blocks, all blocks after the primary
  system prompt block are merged into one before placing the hybrid cache anchor. Prevents the
  same byte-identical system text from moving the `cache_control` breakpoint when the block
  layout changes between merged and split forms, which would bust the cache every turn.
- **Buffered tool-prefix rewriting**: the stream rewriter now holds back any suffix that starts
  a partial `"name"` marker, ensuring `mcp_` tool names spanning two stream chunks are correctly
  stripped even when the chunk boundary falls inside the name string.
- **OAuth fingerprint update**: aligned `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` (`2.1.177`), `USER_AGENT`, and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` (`cli`) with Claude Code 2.1.177 captured traffic
  (from cortexkit/anthropic-auth v1.9.4).

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Improved hybrid 1h prompt-caching breakpoint placement (ported from cortexkit/anthropic-auth):
  - **Rolling latest anchor**: cache breakpoint now placed on the most recent user message beyond
    `messages[1]`, keeping cache hot across long multi-turn sessions.
  - **Bridge anchor**: when the cumulative block distance between the previous and latest user
    anchors exceeds Anthropic's 20-block lookback window, an additional bridge breakpoint is
    inserted at the previous user boundary so all anchors stay within the sliding window.
  - **Magic-context split**: when `messages[0]` contains two or more cacheable blocks (stable
    prefix merged with volatile delta), the first and second blocks are anchored instead of the
    last block, preventing the volatile tail from busting the cache on every turn.
  - **Thinking/redacted_thinking guard**: thinking and redacted_thinking blocks are excluded from
    cache anchor placement; a message whose content is entirely thinking blocks is skipped entirely
    (avoids Anthropic 400 `"Extra inputs are not permitted"` on `cache_control`).
  - **Trailing assistant strip**: assistant-role messages at the tail of the request are removed
    before caching and forwarding; OAuth endpoints reject assistant prefill.

## 1.7.5

### Patch Changes

- [#118](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/118) [`4444663`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/4444663f5a344d2fbe2435fba3d20f24d31259d7) Thanks [@jyapayne](https://github.com/jyapayne)! - Rewrite the phrase "Here is some useful information about the environment you are running in:" in sanitized system prompts. This exact phrase ships verbatim in OpenCode's default system prompt and is used by Anthropic's server-side classifier as a third-party-agent fingerprint — matching it produces a 400 invalid_request_error disguised as "You're out of extra usage." in production. The sentence is now rewritten in place to a semantic equivalent so the model still sees the env-block intro while the request is accepted.
